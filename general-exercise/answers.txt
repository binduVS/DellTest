2. What is the width of a container with 100px of width and 5px of padding?

Padding is the space occupied in between the content and border of a container(div). Padding may effect 
the content-flow style inside the container but it doesn't effect the actual container-width.
so, the width of a container is 100px. 

3. How to apply a click event to all paragraphs except for the last?

    *** javascript: Add same classname to all the paragraphs and exclude the last classname in the for loop

        let nodes = document.getElementsByClassName('classname');
        for(let i=0; i<(nodes.length-1); i++{
            nodes[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
                console.log("clicked");
            });
        }


4. Why does the alert show "Jack" first and then undefined?

    function identity() {
      var name = 'Jack';
      alert(name);
      return
      name
    };
    var who = identity(); // function called
    alert(who)
    
    Because javascript is asynchronous. code executes in multiple threads.
    on line 36, javascript calls identity() and then jumps to next line 37. It doesn't wait till the function
    identity execution completes. So, on line 37 it tries to find 'who' value but fails. so, shows undefined.
